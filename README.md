# TexasDeathRowData
Parses Texas's state death row database using SQLite and stores it in a SQLite database. 
Queries the database to pick an individual from the dataset and show their last words, along with their name and other information.
Inspired by reading Anthony Ray Hinton's autobiography, "The Sun Does Shine".
